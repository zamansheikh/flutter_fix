### Flutter Fix

```bash
flutter pub outdated
flutter pub upgrade --major-versions
flutter clean
flutter pub cache repair
flutter pub get
flutter run
```


# To fix this error, please upgrade your AGP version to at least 8.2.1. The version of AGP that your project uses is likely defined in:
    C:\Users\zaman\Documents\Project-Template\android\settings.gradle,  


In Flutter, you can use the `flutter create` command to create a new Flutter project or add platform-specific folders (e.g., iOS, Android, macOS, Windows, etc.) to an existing project. Here's how to work with it:

---

### **Creating a New Flutter Project**

To create a new Flutter project:

```bash
flutter create project_name
```

- Replace `project_name` with the desired name of your project.
- This creates a default Flutter project with support for iOS, Android, and web by default.

---

### **Adding a Specific Platform**

If you already have a Flutter project and want to add support for a specific platform, you can use:

```bash
flutter create --platforms=platform_name .
```

- Replace `platform_name` with the desired platform (e.g., `ios`, `android`, `windows`, `linux`, `macos`, `web`).
- The `.` at the end tells Flutter to apply the changes to the current directory.

#### **Examples**

1. Add iOS support:
   ```bash
   flutter create --platforms=ios .
   ```

2. Add Windows support:
   ```bash
   flutter create --platforms=windows .
   ```

3. Add multiple platforms:
   ```bash
   flutter create --platforms=ios,android,web .
   ```

---

### **Common Use Cases**

1. **Recreate Platform Folders**
   If platform folders (like `android/`, `ios/`) were deleted or corrupted, you can regenerate them:
   ```bash
   flutter create .
   ```

2. **Enable Desktop Support**
   To create a project with desktop support (Windows, macOS, Linux), ensure you have desktop support enabled:
   ```bash
   flutter config --enable-windows-desktop
   flutter config --enable-macos-desktop
   flutter config --enable-linux-desktop
   ```

   Then, create the project or add the platforms:
   ```bash
   flutter create --platforms=windows,macos,linux .
   ```

3. **Enable Web Support**
   To enable web development, run:
   ```bash
   flutter config --enable-web
   ```

   Then, add web support:
   ```bash
   flutter create --platforms=web .
   ```

---

### **Available Platforms**

The supported platforms are:
- `android`
- `ios`
- `web`
- `windows`
- `linux`
- `macos`

---

### **Verify Platform Support**

Run the following command to check the platforms your Flutter environment supports:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

If any platform is not supported, it will list the missing dependencies or requirements.ðŸš€
